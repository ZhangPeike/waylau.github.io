## Software Engineering

* The wisdom of the software field is not increasing.
软件业的智慧一直没有增长。

* We build systems like the Wright brothers built airplanes — build the whole thing, push it off the cliff, let it crash, and start over again.我们开发软件系统就像莱特兄弟制造飞机——造好整个系统，把它推下悬崖，让它坠毁，然后重新开始。
—— Graham, <http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF>
